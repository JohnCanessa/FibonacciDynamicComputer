# FibonacciDynamicComputer
Experiment and refresh dynamic computer with Fibonacci numbers in Java

This code is to experiment and get ready for additional dynamic programming problems.
The code experiments with different approaches to arrive to bottom up approach using dynamic programming.
We start with a recursive approach to compute a Fibonacci number.
Works well but slows down considerably as the requested Fibonacci number gets larger.
The asame problem is addressed using memoization.
Huge improvement.
To go further, the same problem is implemented with dynamic programming.

Hope you enjoy experiemnting with this code.
Keep on learning;
